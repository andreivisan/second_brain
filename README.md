# Personal Information Management System (PIM)

## Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to aggregate all the notes sources into one system. The system will be able
to tag the notes and search through text and pictures of text or handwritten text.

## Reasons
I am currently using Notion and Apple Notes to store my digital notes. I am also using GoodNotes on 
iPad to take handwritten notes for all the courses I am going through. Besides Kindle Books which are 
easy to annotate and export the notes to Notion, when I am reading physical books, I have no way to 
export notes into any of the systems I use. Given that, my notes are scattered across different apps
and incomplete. I want to have a system that can aggregate all the notes sources into one system.
